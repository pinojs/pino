## Long Term Support

Pino's Long Term Support (LTS) is provided according to the schedule laid
out in this document:

1. Major releases, "X" release of [semantic versioning][semver] X.Y.Z release
   versions, are supported for a minimum period of six months from their release
   date. The release date of any specific version can be found at
   [https://github.com/pinojs/pino/releases](https://github.com/pinojs/pino/releases).

1. Major releases will receive security updates for an additional six months
   from the release of the next major release. After this period
   we will still review and release security fixes as long as they are
   provided by the community and they do not violate other constraints,
   e.g. minimum supported Node.js version.

1. Major releases will be tested and verified against all Node.js
   release lines that are supported by the
   [Node.js LTS policy](https://github.com/nodejs/Release) within the
   LTS period of that given Pino release line. This implies that only
   the latest Node.js release of a given line is supported.

A "month" is defined as 30 consecutive days.

> ## Security Releases and Semver
>
> As a consequence of providing long-term support for major releases, there
> are occasions where we need to release breaking changes as a _minor_
> version release. Such changes will _always_ be noted in the
> [release notes](https://github.com/pinojs/pino/releases).
>
> To avoid automatically receiving breaking security updates it is possible to use
> the tilde (`~`) range qualifier. For example, to get patches for the 6.1
> release, and avoid automatically updating to the 6.1 release, specify
> the dependency as `"pino": "~6.1.x"`. This will leave your application vulnerable,
> so please use with caution.
